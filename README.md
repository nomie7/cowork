## Architecture

![Tiger Cowork Agent Workflow](picture/tiger_cowork_workflow.png)

The diagram above illustrates the **Tool Use & Reasoning Loop** at the core of Tiger Cowork's AI agent:

1. **User Input** — The user sends a message through the chat interface.
2. **Agent Reasoning** — The AI analyzes the query and plans which actions to take.
3. **Need Tools?** — A decision point: if the query can be answered from knowledge alone, the agent returns a **Direct Response**. If tools are needed, it proceeds to tool selection.
4. **Select Tool → Execute Tool** — The agent picks the appropriate tool (e.g. `web_search`, `run_python`, `fetch_url`, `run_react`) and executes it.
5. **Observation** — The tool result is captured and fed back into the agent's context.
6. **Update Context** — Memory and conversation context are updated with the new result.
7. **Task Done?** — Another decision point: if the task requires more information, the agent loops back to select and execute additional tools (configurable, default 8 rounds / 12 calls). Once complete, it proceeds to reflection.
8. **Reflection Loop Check** — If enabled, the agent evaluates whether it satisfied the user's objective (see below). If the score is below the threshold, it re-enters the tool loop to address gaps.
9. **User Output** — The final answer, along with any generated files (charts, components, reports), is delivered to the user.

The bottom section shows all **Available Tools** organized by category — web search, URL fetching, Python/React execution, shell commands, file operations, skill management, ClawHub marketplace, and external MCP tools.

### Agent Reflection Loop Protocol

The Reflection Loop is an optional self-evaluation mechanism that checks whether the agent's work actually satisfied the user's objective before returning a response. When enabled, it adds an extra quality-assurance step after the tool loop completes.

**How it works:**

```

        │          │                           │
        ▼          ▼                           │

               │ loop to fix gaps │  (up to maxReflectionRetries)
               └──────────────────┘
```

1. **Objective Extraction** — The system collects all user messages from the conversation to determine the original objective.
2. **Evaluation Judge** — A separate LLM call evaluates the agent's work. It receives the user objective, a summary of all tool actions taken, and the agent's last response. It returns a structured JSON score:
   ```json
   {"score": 0.95, "satisfied": true, "missing": ""}
   ```
3. **Scoring Guide:**
   - `1.0` — Fully satisfied, all parts addressed
   - `0.7–0.9` — Mostly satisfied, minor gaps
   - `0.4–0.6` — Partially satisfied, significant gaps
   - `0.0–0.3` — Not satisfied, major parts missing
4. **Pass/Fail Decision** — If `score >= agentEvalThreshold` (default 0.7) OR `satisfied: true`, the agent passes and proceeds to generate the final response.
5. **Retry on Failure** — If the score is below the threshold, the system injects a feedback message describing the gaps and re-enters the tool loop. The agent gets additional tool rounds to address what's missing. This retry can repeat up to `agentMaxReflectionRetries` times (default 2).

**Settings for Reflection Loop:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agentReflectionEnabled` | `false` | Enable/disable the reflection evaluation after tool loops |
| `agentEvalThreshold` | `0.7` | Minimum score (0.0–1.0) to pass. Lower = more lenient, higher = stricter |
| `agentMaxReflectionRetries` | `2` | Max times the agent can retry if evaluation fails |

**Example log output when reflection is active:**
```
[ToolLoop] Ended after 5 tool calls.
[Reflection] Settings: enabled=true, threshold=0.7, maxRetries=2, toolCalls=5
[Reflection] User objective (first 200 chars): Tell me who is Sompote Youwai and review about his research
[Reflection] Round 1/2 — evaluating objective satisfaction...
[Reflection] Raw eval response: {"score": 0.95, "satisfied": true, "missing": ""}
[Reflection] Score: 0.95, Satisfied: true, Missing:
[Reflection] Score 0.95 >= threshold 0.7. Objective satisfied.
[ToolLoop] Final total: 5 tool calls. Generating final response...
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Enabled** — Higher quality responses, catches incomplete work, but uses extra API tokens for the evaluation call (and potentially retry rounds)
- **Disabled** — Faster and cheaper, but the agent may return incomplete work without self-checking

### Sub-Agent System

The Sub-Agent system allows the main agent to delegate specific sub-tasks to independent child agents. Each sub-agent runs its own tool loop, has access to the same tools, and returns results back to the parent agent. This enables parallel task decomposition and hierarchical problem solving.

Three operating modes are available:

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Auto** | AI decides when to spawn sub-agents on the fly. Best for ad-hoc tasks. |
| **Spawn Agent** | Agents are defined in a YAML config. The AI spawns them on demand following the workflow sequence. Each agent only gets the tools and downstream targets defined in the config. |
| **Realtime Agent** | All agents from the YAML config boot at session start and stay alive. Tasks are sent via `send_task` / `wait_result` for true parallel execution. Agents communicate through the message bus and protocol tools. |

**How it works (Auto / Spawn Agent mode):**

```

**Key features:**

- **Three modes** — Auto (AI decides), Spawn Agent (YAML-defined, on-demand), Realtime Agent (YAML-defined, always-on)
- **Depth control** — In Auto mode, sub-agents can spawn their own sub-agents up to a configurable max depth (default 2). In Spawn Agent mode, the YAML workflow structure is the boundary — agents can only spawn downstream targets defined in `outputs_to` and connections.
- **Protocol-aware tooling** — Each agent only receives the protocol tools it's configured to use: bus tools if `bus.enabled`, TCP/queue tools only for connected protocols.
- **Concurrency limit** — Controls how many sub-agents can run simultaneously (default 3).
- **Timeout** — Each sub-agent has a configurable timeout (default 120 seconds) enforced via AbortController.
- **Model override** — Sub-agents can use a different model than the parent (e.g. a faster/cheaper model for simple sub-tasks).
- **Real-time status** — All agent events (spawn, tool execution, delegation, completion, errors) are broadcast via Socket.IO with protocol-tagged status messages in the chat UI.
- **Auto-cleanup** — Completed sub-agents are automatically removed from the tracking map after 60 seconds (30 seconds on error).

**Settings for Sub-Agent System:**

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subAgentEnabled` | `false` | Enable/disable sub-agent spawning |
| `subAgentMode` | `auto` | Operating mode: `auto`, `manual` (Spawn Agent), or `realtime` |
| `subAgentConfigFile` | *(empty)* | YAML config file for Spawn Agent / Realtime modes |
| `subAgentModel` | *(empty)* | Model override for sub-agents (uses main model if empty) |
| `subAgentMaxDepth` | `2` | Maximum nesting depth (1–5, Auto mode only) |
| `subAgentMaxConcurrent` | `3` | Maximum simultaneous sub-agents (1–10) |
| `subAgentTimeout` | `120` | Timeout per sub-agent in seconds (30–600) |

Configure these in **Settings > Agent Parameters > Sub-Agent**.

**Example use cases:**
- Research tasks: spawn one sub-agent to search the web while another analyzes local files
- Multi-file operations: delegate file processing to sub-agents in parallel
- Complex analysis: break a report into sections, each handled by a dedicated sub-agent
- Realtime orchestration: boot an entire agent team (orchestrator + workers + checker) and send tasks for true parallel execution with inter-agent communication via bus

## What's New in v0.2.2

- **Realtime Agent Mode** — New sub-agent operating mode where all agents from a YAML config boot at session start and stay alive. Tasks are sent via `send_task` / `wait_result` tools for true parallel execution. Agents communicate through the message bus and protocol tools. The orchestrator delegates to the agent team hierarchy automatically.
- **New orchestrator tools** — `send_task` (assign work to a running agent), `wait_result` (block until agent finishes), `check_agents` (view status of all agents in the session).
- **Bus toggle per agent** — Individual agents can be connected/disconnected from the shared message bus in the Agent Editor. Configure bus topics per agent for targeted pub/sub communication.
- **Protocol-aware tool filtering** — Sub-agents now only receive the protocol tools they're configured to use (bus tools only if `bus.enabled`, TCP/queue tools only for connected protocols), reducing noise and preventing misuse.
- **Agent Editor file manager** — Upload, load, and delete YAML architecture files directly within the Agent Editor. A collapsible file manager panel shows all existing configs with agent count and metadata.
- **YAML upload in Settings** — Upload YAML agent config files directly from the Settings page alongside the existing Swarm Agent Creator.
- **Port-based connection drawing** — Agent nodes now have distinct input (left) and output (right) port dots. Drag from an output port to an input port to create connections — no more shift+drag required.
- **Free-text model input** — Model selection changed from a hardcoded dropdown to a free-text input, supporting any model name from any provider.
- **Spawn Agent mode renamed** — "Manual" mode renamed to "Spawn Agent" in the Settings UI for clarity. Agents in this mode now respect workflow boundaries — they can only spawn downstream targets defined in `outputs_to` and connections.
- **Improved realtime status UI** — Chat shows detailed realtime agent lifecycle events: ready, working, delegating, waiting, tool calls with protocol tags, and completion status.

### Previous: v0.2.1

- **Agent System Editor** — A new visual editor for designing multi-agent systems. Build agent teams on a drag-and-drop canvas, define roles (orchestrator, worker, checker, reporter, researcher), set models, personas, and responsibilities. Connect agents with configurable communication protocols (TCP, Bus, Queue) and export the entire system as YAML. Includes AI-assisted agent setup — describe what you need and the editor generates the definition.
- **Agent YAML management** — New backend API for listing, creating, parsing, and generating agent configuration files stored in `data/agents/`.
- **Protocol status endpoint** — New `/api/agents/protocols/status` endpoint for monitoring inter-agent communication protocols.

### Previous: v0.2.0

- **Sub-Agent System** — The main agent can now spawn independent sub-agents to handle specific sub-tasks. Each sub-agent gets its own tool loop and can use all available tools. Supports configurable depth limits, concurrency, timeout, and optional model override. Enable in Settings > Agent Parameters > Sub-Agent.
- **New sub-agent settings** — Five new parameters: `subAgentEnabled` (on/off), `subAgentModel` (optional model override), `subAgentMaxDepth` (1–5, default 2), `subAgentMaxConcurrent` (1–10, default 3), `subAgentTimeout` (30–600s, default 120s).
- **New tool: `spawn_subagent`** — Allows the AI to delegate sub-tasks with a task description, optional label, and optional context.
- **Real-time sub-agent status** — Socket.IO broadcasts sub-agent lifecycle events (spawn, tool calls, completion, errors) to the chat UI.

### Previous: v0.1.5

- **Agent Reflection Loop** — After the tool loop completes, the agent now self-evaluates whether it satisfied the user's objective. A separate LLM call scores the work 0.0–1.0. If the score is below the threshold (default 0.7), the agent automatically retries to address gaps. Enable in Settings > Agent Parameters > Reflection Enabled.
- **New reflection settings** — Three new parameters: `agentReflectionEnabled` (on/off), `agentEvalThreshold` (pass score 0.0–1.0), `agentMaxReflectionRetries` (max retry attempts).
- **Bug fix: reflection was never triggered** — The previous tool loop had an early `return` that skipped the reflection block entirely. Changed to `break` so the code flows through to the evaluation step.

### Previous: v0.1.4

- **Working folder: Sandbox vs External** — Projects now let you choose where the working folder lives. **In Sandbox** creates a folder inside the sandbox directory with full access. **External Folder** lets you mount any local path (outside the sandbox) with configurable access levels.
- **Agent access control** — External folders support three access levels: **Read Only** (agent can only read files), **Read & Write** (agent can read and write), and **Full Access** (agent can read, write, and execute shell commands). Sandbox folders always have full access.
- **Docker volume mount generator** — The Overview tab includes a "Docker Volume Mounts" button that generates ready-to-copy `docker run` and `docker-compose` volume configurations for all external project folders, with correct `:ro`/`:rw` flags.
- **Configurable agent parameters** — Settings page now has an "Agent Parameters" section to tune: Max Tool Rounds (default 8), Max Tool Calls (default 12), Max Consecutive Errors (default 3), and Tool Result Max Length (default 6000). Increase these for complex research tasks that were previously cut short.
- **Server-side access enforcement** — `write_file` and `run_shell` tools respect the project's access level. Read-only projects block writes; only full-access projects allow shell commands.

## Features

## Security Notice

> **⚠️ This app can execute shell commands, Python code, and install third-party skills.** For safety, it is strongly recommended to run Tiger Cowork inside a sandboxed environment such as a **Docker container**.

### Recommended: Run in Docker (Ubuntu)

```bash
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 ubuntu bash

# Inside the container:
apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl git python3 python3-pip
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs

node --version

git clone https://github.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork.git
cd tiger_cowork
bash setup.sh

# Set access token (recommended)
echo 'ACCESS_TOKEN=your-secret-token' > .env

npm run dev
```

This ensures that any code execution, shell commands, or skill scripts run in an isolated environment and cannot affect your host system.

### Mounting External Folders in Docker

To let the app access folders on your host machine, use Docker `-v` volume mounts when starting the container.

#### Quick start (no external folders)

```bash
# Run the app without any external folders — uses only the internal /app directory
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 ubuntu bash
# Then install and run inside the container (see above)
```

#### Mount a parent folder for full access

The easiest approach — mount a large parent folder so you can access anything inside it from the app without restarting Docker:

```bash
# macOS
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /Users/yourname:/mnt/host:rw \
  ubuntu bash

# Linux
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /home/yourname:/mnt/host:rw \
  ubuntu bash
```

Then in the app, create a project with **External Folder** pointing to `/mnt/host/any-subfolder`.

#### Mount specific folders

```bash
# Mount a single folder (read-write)
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /Users/yourname/research:/mnt/projects/research:rw \
  ubuntu bash

# Mount read-only
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /Users/yourname/data:/mnt/projects/data:ro \
  ubuntu bash

# Mount multiple folders
docker run -it -p 3001:3001 \
  -v /Users/yourname/project-a:/mnt/projects/a:rw \
  -v /Users/yourname/project-b:/mnt/projects/b:ro \
  ubuntu bash
```

#### Important notes

- **Folders must be mounted at startup** — you cannot add new host folders after the container is running. If you need a new folder, stop and restart with the updated `-v` flags.
- **Tip:** Mount a big parent folder (like your home directory) to avoid restarting when you need to access a new subfolder.
- `:rw` = read-write access, `:ro` = read-only access.

#### Auto-generate mount commands from the app

You can also generate these commands automatically:
1. Create projects with **External Folder** working folders
2. Set the desired access level for each
3. Go to **Overview** tab > **Docker Volume Mounts** to get the exact `docker run` and `docker-compose` commands

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Python 3** (optional, for Python code execution)
- **API Key** for any OpenAI-compatible provider (OpenRouter, TigerBot, Ollama, etc.)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sompote/tiger_cowork.git
cd tiger_cowork
```

### 2. Quick setup (recommended)

Run the interactive setup script — it installs dependencies and prompts for your ClawHub token:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install server and client dependencies
- Prompt you to enter your **ClawHub token** (get one at [clawhub.ai](https://www.clawhub.ai))
- Create `.env` from `.env.example`

> You can skip the ClawHub token by pressing Enter. To login later: `clawhub login`

### 2b. Manual install (alternative)

```bash
npm i -g clawhub
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
clawhub login   # optional: authenticate with ClawHub
```

### 3. Set up access token (optional but recommended)

Create a `.env` file to protect the app with an access token:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set your token:

```env
ACCESS_TOKEN=your-secret-token-here
```

If you skip this step, the app will run without authentication (open to anyone who can reach it).

### 4. Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app starts at **http://localhost:3001**. If you set an access token, you'll see a login screen — enter your token to continue.

### 5. Build and run for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### 6. Running in background (production)

**Option A — Using `nohup`** (simple, no extra dependencies):

```bash
npm run build
nohup npm start > output.log 2>&1 &
```

- Logs are written to `output.log`
- The server keeps running after you close the terminal
- To stop: `kill $(lsof -t -i:3001)` or find the PID with `ps aux | grep tsx`

**Option B — Using PM2** (recommended for production):

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install -g pm2

# Build and start
npm run build
pm2 start npm --name "cowork" -- start

# Useful PM2 commands
pm2 status          # Check running processes
pm2 logs cowork     # View logs
pm2 restart cowork  # Restart the app
pm2 stop cowork     # Stop the app
pm2 delete cowork   # Remove from PM2

# Auto-start on system reboot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

1. Open the app at `http://localhost:3001`
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the sidebar
3. Enter your **API Key** (any OpenAI-compatible provider)
4. Set the **API URL** — e.g. `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for OpenRouter
5. Choose a **Model** — e.g. `z-ai/glm-5`, `TigerBot-70B-Chat`, etc.
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify

### Access Token Protection

Tiger Cowork supports a simple access token to protect the app from unauthorized access. When enabled, users must enter the token before they can use the app.

**Setup:**

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (or copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Set your access token:

```env
ACCESS_TOKEN=your-secret-token-here
```

3. Restart the server — a login screen will appear requiring the token.

**How it works:**

- All `/api/*` routes require a valid `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Socket.IO connections require the token via `auth.token` in the handshake
- The client stores the token in `localStorage` after successful login
- If the token is invalid or missing, the client shows a login screen
- File downloads pass the token via `?token=` query parameter
- To **disable** auth, leave `ACCESS_TOKEN` empty or remove it from `.env`

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Default            | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | *(empty)*          | Access token to protect the app (leave empty to disable) |
| `PORT`         | `3001`             | Server port                          |
| `SANDBOX_DIR`  | `.` (project root) | Directory for file manager sandbox   |
| `NODE_ENV`     | `development`      | Set to `production` for built assets |

```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN=mysecret PORT=8080 SANDBOX_DIR=/home/user/workspace npm run dev
```

### MCP Server Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** > MCP Tools
2. Add a server with a name and URL:
   - HTTP/SSE: `https://mcp-server.example.com/sse`
   - Stdio: `node /path/to/mcp-server.js`
3. Enable the server — tools are auto-discovered
4. Connected MCP tools appear as `mcp_{serverName}_{toolName}` in the AI's toolbox

## Usage Guide

### Chat with AI

1. Open the app — you land on the **Chat** page
2. Type a message and press Enter
3. The AI responds and can automatically use tools:

## Changelog

### v0.2.2 (2026-03-15)
- Add **Realtime Agent Mode** — all agents boot at session start and stay alive for true parallel execution via `send_task` / `wait_result` / `check_agents` tools
- New orchestrator tools: `send_task` (assign work), `wait_result` (collect results), `check_agents` (view session status)
- Add **bus toggle per agent** in Agent Editor — enable/disable shared message bus with configurable topics per agent
- Add **protocol-aware tool filtering** — sub-agents only receive protocol tools matching their config (bus, TCP, queue)
- Add **Agent Editor file manager** — upload, load, and delete YAML architecture files directly within the editor
- Add **YAML upload** in Settings page alongside Swarm Agent Creator
- Change connection drawing to **port-based** — drag from output port (right) to input port (left) instead of shift+drag
- Change model selection to **free-text input** — supports any model name from any provider
- Rename "Manual" sub-agent mode to **"Spawn Agent"** for clarity; agents now respect workflow boundaries (only spawn downstream targets from `outputs_to` and connections)
- Add `busWaitForMessage` helper for async message waiting with timeout/abort support in protocols service
- Improve chat UI status messages with realtime agent lifecycle events (ready, working, delegating, waiting, protocol-tagged tool calls)
- Add upload error feedback UI for YAML file validation failures

### v0.2.1 (2026-03-14)
- Add **Agent System Editor** — visual drag-and-drop canvas for designing multi-agent systems with role-based agent nodes, connection drawing, and communication protocol configuration (TCP, Bus, Queue)
- AI-assisted agent setup: describe an agent in natural language to auto-generate role, persona, model, and responsibilities
- Support for four orchestration modes: Hierarchical, Flat, Mesh, Pipeline
- YAML export with full system metadata, agent definitions, workflow sequences, and connection topology
- New backend routes: agent config CRUD (`/api/agents`), YAML parse/generate, protocol status
- New `AgentEditor` component (`client/src/components/AgentEditor.tsx`) with canvas, SVG connection layer, and right-side definition panel
- New `protocols.ts` service for inter-agent communication protocol monitoring

### v0.2.0 (2026-03-12)
- Add **Sub-Agent System** — main agent can spawn independent sub-agents to handle sub-tasks with their own tool loops, depth control, concurrency limits, and timeout enforcement
- New tool: `spawn_subagent` with `task`, `label`, and `context` parameters
- New settings: `subAgentEnabled`, `subAgentModel`, `subAgentMaxDepth` (default 2), `subAgentMaxConcurrent` (default 3), `subAgentTimeout` (default 120s)
- Real-time sub-agent status broadcasting via Socket.IO (spawn, tool calls, completion, errors)
- Sub-agent tracking with auto-cleanup (60s after completion, 30s after error)
- Depth-aware tool filtering: `spawn_subagent` tool is excluded at max depth to prevent infinite recursion

### v0.1.5 (2026-03-10)
- Add **Agent Reflection Loop** — self-evaluation protocol that checks whether the agent satisfied the user's objective after tool loops, with automatic retry on failure
- New settings: `agentReflectionEnabled`, `agentEvalThreshold` (default 0.7), `agentMaxReflectionRetries` (default 2)
- Fix critical bug: reflection block was unreachable due to early `return` in the tool loop — changed to `break` so execution flows through to reflection
- Add safe content handling for null/non-string user messages in reflection objective extraction
- Add outer try-catch around reflection block to prevent silent crashes
- Add diagnostic logging: reflection settings, user objective preview, and evaluation scores appear in server logs

### v0.1.4 (2026-03-09)
- Add working folder location choice: **In Sandbox** (full access) or **External Folder** (with configurable access level)
- Add agent access control for external folders: Read Only, Read & Write, Full Access — enforced server-side on `write_file` and `run_shell` tools
- Add Docker volume mount generator in project Overview tab — generates `docker run` and `docker-compose` volume configs
- Add configurable Agent Parameters in Settings: max tool rounds, max tool calls, max consecutive errors, tool result max length
- Sandbox folders auto-resolve relative names to `{sandboxDir}/name`

### v0.1.3 (2026-03-09)
- Add Projects feature with dedicated working folder, persistent memory, skill selection, and file browser per project
- Add output panel to project chat (React/JSX, images, HTML, PDF, Word document rendering)
- Add Word/PDF document preview in output panel using mammoth and pdf-parse
- Add image attachment support with automatic compression for vision API
- Fix mobile formatting: reduce font sizes and prevent table overflow
- Fix outputFiles propagation through error handlers in socket service

### v0.1.2 (2026-03-08)
- Add access token authentication to protect the app (`.env` based, optional)
- Fix context overflow causing "No response from API" after tool loops
- Improve tool loop reliability with loop detection and error tracking
- Add automatic chart generation retry for analysis tasks
- Add `ReactComponentRenderer` for native React component rendering
- Add MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Stdio/SSE/StreamableHTTP
- Add `.gitignore` entries for `output_file/`, `input_file/`, and chat history

### v0.1.1
- Improve tool loop reliability and chart generation for analysis tasks

### v0.1.0
- Initial release: Express + Vite web app with AI chat, file manager, Python execution, scheduled tasks, skills marketplace, and web search
